Sentiment Analysis
Project Title: "Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch"

Overview: Briefly describe the project—sentiment analysis using PyTorch, built for a competition, achieved 78% accuracy.

Features: List key aspects—text preprocessing, ensemble model (LSTM, GRU, Transformer), training, prediction output.

Requirements: List dependencies—Python 3.8+, PyTorch 2.0.1, TorchText 0.15.2, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TQDM.

Installation: Steps to set up—clone repo, install dependencies with pip.

Dataset: Mention expected input—train.csv and test.csv with sentence and gold_label columns.

Usage: Basic instructions—run the script, train the model, generate predictions in answer_dev.txt.

Model Details: Quick summary—300D embeddings, bidirectional LSTM/GRU, Transformer, 3-class output.

Results: Highlight accuracy—78% on test set, plus loss/accuracy plots.

Notes: Add key info—uses basic_english tokenizer, GPU/CPU support, tuned batch size (64).
